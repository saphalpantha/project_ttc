 m : n => 1 1 1
	
 1: m => merge relationship with many side  (2 tables) B side


 m : 1 => merge relationhip with many side ( 2 table) A side 


 1 : 1 => R can merge either for A or B




ALSO GIVEN CARDINALITY CONSTRAINTS

TOTAL  => FOREIGN KEY ( NOT NULL)

CASE 1 : binary relationship with cardinality constraints and total participation constraints from 
[ONE SIDE]
=> merge many side



CASE 1 : binary relationship with cardinality constraints and total participation constraints from 
[BOTH SIDE]

=> merge all and make one table
